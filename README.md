# Konect-Aggregate-Statistics
Aggregate statistics from the http://konect.cc/ project

Webscraped data on the networks over on the KONECT project. The `dataset.csv` contains all statistics (http://konect.cc/statistics/) for all the KONECT networks (http://konect.cc/networks/). Not all statistics are or can be computed for all networks, so that explains most NaN values.

The scraping script is not the most flexible, especially scraping the initial names and their hyperlinks is done quite innefficient and can most certainly be done better. (Specific hyperlink scraping instead of parsing the html or something similar).
